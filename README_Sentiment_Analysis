Sentiment Analysis Project (Python)
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text using the transformers library for machine learning-based sentiment analysis and the textblob library for rule-based sentiment analysis. The script combines the results from both methods to provide a more nuanced sentiment analysis.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Sentiment_Analysis
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers textblob
If you are using PyCharm, you can also install the libraries through PyCharm preferences.

Usage
To analyze sentiment in your text:

python
Copy code
# Open the script Sentiment_Analysis.py in PyCharm.

# Update the text to be analyzed in the text_to_analyze variables.

# Run the script.
Custom Threshold Adjustment
To customize the sentiment classification based on your criteria, adjust the custom_threshold variable in the script. This threshold determines when to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment score.

python
Copy code
# Adjust the threshold as needed
custom_threshold = -0.5
Troubleshooting
Library Installation
If you encounter issues with library installations, ensure that you are installing the libraries in the correct virtual environment. If using PyCharm, install the libraries through PyCharm preferences.

Sentiment Analysis Results
The sentiment analysis results might not always align with expectations. Consider adjusting the custom_threshold based on your specific criteria for sentiment classification.
